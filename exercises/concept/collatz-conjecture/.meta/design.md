# Design

## Goal

Teach the students the basics of mutability and loops.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a mutable variable
- Mutate a mutable variable
- Create a `while` loop

## Out of scope

- `for` loops
- `loop` loops

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `mutability`: know what mutability is and how to use it
- `loops`: know what loops are and how to use them

## Prerequisites

- `functions`: this exercise requires students to create a function used within another function
- `integers`: this exercise requires knowledge of the fundamentals of integers and integer operations
