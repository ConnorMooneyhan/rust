# Hints

## 1. Compute the next value in a Collatz sequence

- To detect whether a number is even or odd, you can use the `%` operator to discover whether it has a remainder after being divided by 2.

## 2. Count the number of steps for a Collatz sequence to reach 1

- It is legal to reassign a mutable variable to an expression computed using its previous value. This permits operations like `x = x + 1`.
